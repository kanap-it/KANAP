# On-Premise: Microsoft Entra SSO Setup

This guide explains how to enable Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) SSO for an on-premise KANAP deployment.
Entra SSO is optional; if you do not configure it, local email/password authentication remains available.

## Overview

KANAP uses the OAuth2/OIDC authorization code flow as a confidential client.
Each on-prem customer **must register their own Entra application** and provide its client ID/secret.

### What the customer provides

- An Entra App Registration **in their tenant**
- `ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` and `ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `ENTRA_AUTHORITY` pointing to their tenant
- `ENTRA_REDIRECT_URI` matching their KANAP URL

## Prerequisites

- A public HTTPS URL for KANAP (reverse proxy in front of the API)
- Ability to create an App Registration and grant admin consent in Entra
- Outbound connectivity from the KANAP API container to:
  - `login.microsoftonline.com` (OIDC metadata, token exchange, JWKS)
  - `graph.microsoft.com` (profile enrichment at sign-in and the daily directory sync)

## Step 1: Create an App Registration (Entra)

1. Open **Microsoft Entra ID → App registrations → New registration**
2. Name: `KANAP (on-prem)`
3. Supported account types: **Single tenant** (recommended)
4. Redirect URI (Web):  
   `https://<your-kanap-domain>/api/auth/entra/callback`
5. Save and record:
   - **Application (client) ID**
   - **Directory (tenant) ID**

## Step 2: Create a Client Secret

1. Go to **Certificates & secrets**
2. Create a new **Client secret**
3. Copy the **secret value** (it is shown only once)

## Step 3: API permissions

KANAP needs two sets of permissions: delegated permissions for interactive sign-in, and one application permission for the daily directory sync.

### Delegated permissions (sign-in)

Every sign-in request asks Entra for exactly these scopes:

```
openid profile email offline_access User.Read
```

Add all five as **configured** permissions on the app registration:

1. Open **App registrations → your KANAP app → API permissions**
2. **Add a permission → Microsoft Graph → Delegated permissions**
3. Select `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `offline_access` and `User.Read`
4. Click **Add permissions**

`User.Read` lets KANAP read the signed-in person's own profile from Microsoft Graph so it can fill in their name, job title, phones, department and company. Keep it. It is a separate permission from `User.Read.All`, not an older version of it. Without it, users are prompted for consent at every sign-in or the sign-in fails.

!!! warning "Add the OIDC scopes before granting admin consent"
    Tenant-wide admin consent rewrites the app's grant to match the **configured** permission list. `openid`, `profile`, `email` and `offline_access` are usually listed under "Other permissions granted" and are not configured by default, so a tenant-wide consent would drop them and break existing sign-ins. The Azure portal shows this warning itself. Add the four scopes as configured delegated permissions first, then grant consent.

### Application permission (daily directory sync)

The nightly directory sync runs without a signed-in user, so it needs an application permission:

1. **API permissions → Add a permission → Microsoft Graph → Application permissions**
2. Select **`User.Read.All`**
3. Click **Add permissions**

The new row now shows the status **Not granted** with an orange warning. That is expected. The permission becomes usable once a Microsoft Entra administrator grants tenant-wide consent, which is done from KANAP in [Step 7](#step-7-authorize-the-daily-directory-sync).

Who does what:

- **Hosted KANAP**: the KANAP operator owns the app registration and adds the permission. The customer's Entra administrator only grants consent.
- **On-premise**: the customer's own IT owns the app registration, so they add the permission and grant consent.

### If you do not want Graph calls at sign-in

```
ENTRA_ENRICH_PROFILE=false
```

This only skips the Microsoft Graph `/me` call made during sign-in. Names and other profile fields then come from the ID token alone. It does not turn off the daily directory sync, which uses its own application permission.

## Step 4: Configure KANAP Environment Variables

Set the following in your on-prem `.env`:

```bash
# Entra SSO (on-prem)
ENTRA_CLIENT_ID=<application-client-id>
ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret>
ENTRA_AUTHORITY=https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>
ENTRA_REDIRECT_URI=https://kanap.company.com/api/auth/entra/callback
```

Notes:
- `ENTRA_AUTHORITY` should be **tenant-specific** for on-prem.
- `ENTRA_REDIRECT_URI` must match **exactly** what you registered in Entra.
- Make sure `APP_BASE_URL` is set to the public URL so the post-login redirect is correct.

## Step 5: Restart KANAP

After updating `.env`, restart your containers so the API picks up the new configuration.

## Step 6: Connect Entra in KANAP

1. Log in as an admin
2. Go to **Admin → Authentication**
3. In the **Microsoft Entra ID** card, click **Connect**
4. Approve consent in Entra
5. Use **Test sign-in** to confirm end-to-end login

## Step 7: Authorize the daily directory sync

The **Daily directory sync** block appears on **Admin → Authentication** once Entra is connected. Until a Microsoft Entra administrator approves it, the block shows:

> Not authorized yet. A Microsoft Entra administrator must grant KANAP permission to read directory users.

To approve it:

1. Sign in to KANAP as an admin who is also a Microsoft Entra administrator
2. Go to **Admin → Authentication → Daily directory sync**
3. Click **Grant access in Microsoft Entra**
4. Approve the request on Microsoft's consent page

You come back to KANAP with the message **Access granted. The first sync is running.** The "Not authorized yet" line disappears.

You can also grant the consent from the Azure portal with **Grant admin consent for &lt;tenant&gt;** on the API permissions page. KANAP then only notices at the next sync. Click **Sync now** to check immediately. Because KANAP caches its Microsoft token, the first attempt right after a portal grant can still report "not authorized". Click **Sync now** again and it succeeds. The nightly run recovers on its own in any case.

## The daily directory sync

Once authorized, KANAP contacts Microsoft Graph every night at 03:00 server time and, for every user linked to Entra:

- Refreshes first name, last name, job title, business phone, mobile phone
- Matches the directory department and company **by name** against existing KANAP records. Nothing is created automatically, and a name with no match leaves the assignment unchanged.
- Sets the interface language only if the person has not chosen one
- Disables the KANAP account if the person was removed from the directory, or if their directory account was deactivated (`accountEnabled` is false)

Empty directory values never clear data already in KANAP.

Disabling an account signs the person out immediately and blocks any further sign-in. Their data and history are kept.

The block on **Admin → Authentication** reports the outcome: **Last synced {date} — N accounts refreshed, N disabled.** after a successful run, or **The last sync failed: {message}** otherwise. **Sync now** runs the same job on demand.

## Troubleshooting

- **SSO_NOT_CONFIGURED**: Entra env vars are missing or tenant is not connected. Users see "Sign-in with Microsoft is not set up for this workspace."
- **ENTRA_TENANT_MISMATCH**: You connected one tenant but are trying to sign in from another. Users see "This Microsoft account belongs to a different organization than the one connected to this workspace."
- **ENTRA_EMAIL_UNVERIFIED**: The Microsoft account email address is not verified, so it cannot be used to sign in.
- **Invalid Entra state / nonce**: The sign-in state expired or the Entra redirect did not return to the configured callback URL. Retry sign-in and verify `ENTRA_REDIRECT_URI` exactly matches the Entra app registration.
- **Bad redirect after login**: Check `APP_BASE_URL` and reverse proxy headers (`Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`).
- **"Not authorized yet" on the directory sync**: either the application permission `User.Read.All` was never added to the app registration, or a Microsoft Entra administrator has not granted tenant-wide consent yet. Check both, then click **Sync now**.
- **Sign-ins started failing right after granting admin consent**: the consent replaced the app's grant with the configured permission list, dropping `openid`, `profile`, `email` and `offline_access`. Add them as configured delegated permissions and grant consent again.
- **Expired client secret**: Microsoft returns `AADSTS7000222`. Users only see the generic "Sign-in with Microsoft did not complete. Try again or ask your administrator." on the login page. To confirm the cause, look at **Admin → Authentication → Daily directory sync**: the failure line quotes the Microsoft error code. Re-running **Connect** also shows it. Create a new client secret in **Certificates & secrets**, update `ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET`, and restart the API.

## Security Notes

- Do not commit `ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET` to git.
- Rotate the secret periodically.
- Use a dedicated app registration.
