# Usage & costs

This page answers two questions an administrator asks regularly: *how much are we using AI?* and *what is it costing us?* It covers the whole organization — the [Plaid chat assistant](ai-assistant.md) and every [AI agent](agents-overview.md) together — with costs priced from the real prices you recorded on the [AI models](ai-models.md) page. The conversation and token figures used to live at the bottom of the Plaid settings page; they now live here, next to the money.

## Where to find it

- Workspace: **Admin**
- Path: **Admin → Artificial intelligence → Usage & costs**
- Route: `/admin/ai-usage`
- Permission: `ai_settings:admin`

Everything on this page is read-only; it is a report, not a set of controls. Two time windows run throughout: **Current month** (since the 1st) and **Last 30 days** (a rolling window). They rarely match, and both are useful — the month for budgets, the rolling window for spotting a change of pace.

## Costs

Three cards across the top:

- **Total this month** — agents plus Plaid, with the last-30-days figure underneath. Because the two halves are worked out differently — see below — the total mixes a measured figure with an estimated one.
- **Agents this month** — what the agent fleet actually cost, with the last-30-days figure underneath.
- **Plaid this month** — what the chat assistant cost. This card uses its caption for the estimate warning below rather than a 30-day figure.

Costs are shown in euros to the cent, and to four decimals when the amount is under a cent — early on, or with a cheap model, a real total genuinely can be `0.0034 €`.

**Agent costs are measured.** Every model call an agent makes records its input and output tokens, priced there and then at the rates of the model that agent was using — and the result is kept. That is why the [AI models](ai-models.md) prices matter, why a model registered without prices contributes nothing here, and why editing a price later does not rewrite what agents already cost. (When a provider returns no token counts of its own, KANAP estimates them from the size of the exchange, so a small part of the figure can be approximate.)

**The Plaid figure is an estimate**, and the card says so: *Estimated at the currently assigned model's rates*. Chat messages record their token usage but not what they cost at the time, so KANAP prices the whole window using whatever model is assigned to Plaid *today*. Two consequences: if you switched Plaid to a cheaper model mid-month, the estimate applies the new rates to the old traffic; and if you correct a price on the [AI models](ai-models.md) page, past Plaid figures move with it. Treat it as an order of magnitude, not an invoice line. If the assigned model is free, the caption changes to *The assigned model has no cost* and the figure is zero.

The **KANAP included model** costs 0 € by design — it is part of your subscription. An organization running entirely on the included model will see zeros here, and should watch the included-message allowance on the [AI models](ai-models.md) page instead.

### Cost by agent and Cost by model

Two tables appear underneath as soon as there is agent activity to report, each with a **Current month** and a **Last 30 days** column.

- **Cost by agent** — one row per agent, so you can see which one is expensive. Pair it with the agent's own **Cost per run** cap on its [Settings tab](agents-workspace.md) if a number looks wrong.
- **Cost by model** — the same spend sliced by model, sorted with the most expensive over 30 days first. Rows are the provider and model identifiers that were actually called (`anthropic:claude-sonnet-5`, `ollama:mistral`), not the friendly names you gave them on the [AI models](ai-models.md) page. A row labelled **Unknown model** is older activity recorded before per-call model attribution existed.

Both tables cover **agent runs**. Plaid's estimate is not broken down here — it appears only in the **Plaid this month** card.

## Conversations

Four unlabelled cards sit between the cost tables and the token table, all about the chat assistant:

- **All conversations** — every conversation currently stored. If you set a **Conversation retention (days)** period on the [Plaid settings](ai-settings.md) page, conversations eventually get purged and stop counting here.
- **Active conversations (7d)** and **Active conversations (30d)** — conversations updated in the last 7 or 30 days.
- **Active users (30d)** — how many distinct people actually used chat in the last 30 days. The most honest adoption number on the page.

---

## Token usage

One table, two rows — **Current month** and **Last 30 days** — with **Input tokens**, **Output tokens**, **Total tokens**, and **User messages** (the number of questions asked in that window).

**This table is about chat, not agents.** These are the Plaid assistant's tokens, and they are exactly the numbers the **Plaid this month** estimate is priced from. Agent consumption is not counted here — it shows up in **Cost by agent** and in **Agent messages** below. That is worth remembering when you run on the included model or a local one, where cost is always zero but consumption still is not.

---

## Agent messages (this month)

One card per agent, busiest first. **All agents** gives the combined count of tickets reviewed this month, then each agent shows its own count, captioned with its last-30-days figure. Every agent you have appears here, including ones that have done nothing yet — a card sitting at 0 is itself worth noticing. Archived agents are left out.

This is the per-organization view of what each agent's own workspace shows individually. Read it alongside **Cost by agent**: an agent with many messages and little cost is running on a free or cheap model; an agent with few messages and high cost is doing expensive work per ticket and is worth a look.

## Tips

- **Compare the two windows, not just the totals.** *Current month* on the 3rd of the month looks tiny; the rolling 30-day figure next to it is what tells you whether anything actually changed.
- **Prices in, costs out.** These figures are only as good as the prices on the [AI models](ai-models.md) page. If a cost looks impossibly low, check that the model has prices at all — an empty price field reads as free.
- **Don't reconcile the Plaid estimate against your provider's invoice.** It is priced at today's rates for the whole window, by design. The agent figures are the ones built from real per-call measurements.
- **Use Cost by model when you're weighing a change.** It shows what each model is really costing you across all your agents, which is the number to compare before moving work onto a cheaper one.
- **Zero cost is not zero usage.** On the included model or a local one, every cost figure stays at €0 — **Agent messages** is where agent load shows up, and the token table is where chat load does.
