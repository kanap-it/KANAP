# AI Agents — Activity

Activity is the read-only history of everything your agents have done and everything you have decided about their work: the checks they ran, the proposals they drafted, your approvals and rejections, the changes that were actually sent to a ticket, safety limits that kicked in, pauses, configuration changes, and errors. Nothing on this page changes a ticket or an agent — it exists so you can answer "what happened, when, and why" after the fact, and to give you a paper trail when a requester or a technician asks. The same timeline appears, already filtered to one agent, at the bottom of that agent's [Monitor tab](agents-workspace.md); this page is the full version across every agent.

## Where to find it

- Workspace: **AI Agents**
- Path: **AI Agents → Activity**
- Route: `/agents/activity`
- Permission: `ai_agents:reader` (viewing only — everyone who can open AI Agents can read the timeline)
- Requires AI to be enabled on the instance. This page is read-only: nothing here approves, rejects, or sends anything. To act on a proposal, use [Approvals](agents-approvals.md).

## Filters

The timeline shows the most recent events first. Two controls narrow it down:

- **Ticket number** — type a ticket number and press **Search** (or Enter) to see only the events tied to that one ticket. This is the fastest way to reconstruct the full story of a single ticket: every check, draft, decision, and change, in order. Clear the box and search again to return to the full feed.
- **Type chips** — seven toggles across the top: **Proposal**, **Decision**, **Execution**, **Configuration**, **Checks**, **Pause**, and **Error**. Each one is an on/off switch, not a single choice: a filled chip is included, an outlined one is excluded, and you can combine as many as you like.

**By default every category is on except Checks.** That default is deliberate. A watching agent writes a check entry every few minutes whether or not it found anything, and left on, those rows bury the entries you actually read. Turn **Checks** on when you want to confirm an agent is alive, or when you're investigating why it did — or didn't — pick something up.

Turning every chip off leaves nothing to show, and the timeline says so: *Pick at least one activity type to see the timeline.*

The ticket search and the type chips combine, so you can look at, say, only the errors on ticket #482. Your selection lives in the page address, so a filtered view is a link you can send to a colleague.

## Reading a timeline entry

Each entry is one thing that happened, and it carries enough context to understand it at a glance:

- A **type chip** — which of the seven categories above the event belongs to.
- An **action-type chip** (when the event is about a specific kind of ticket work): **Internal note**, **Requester reply**, **Classification update**, **Status update**, **Assignment**, or **Participants**.
- A **status dot** with a plain-language label (for example "Waiting for approval", "Done", "Rejected", "Dismissed", "Needs attention") describing where that item stands.
- The **agent name** and the **ticket** it concerns (shown as `#N`).
- An **event title** — for example "Proposal created", or "Ticket check — 3 new tickets".
- A **one-line preview** of the substance — the first line of a drafted message, a field change, or the reason — so you often don't need to expand anything.
- A **timestamp**, plus **Show details** and, where a check is behind the event, **Trace**.

Titles adapt to the kind of agent: what reads **Ticket check** on a helpdesk agent reads **Alert check** on a monitoring one, so a mixed fleet stays legible.

### What the events mean

The catalog covers the whole lifecycle of agent work. Grouped by the type chip they fall under:

- **Proposal** — the agent drafted something for review: a reply, note, or ticket update was created and is waiting for a decision.
- **Decision** — a proposal was **approved**, **rejected**, or **dismissed** (set aside without counting against the agent), or an attention item was **acknowledged**. Approvals and rejections can also happen automatically once that action type is running on its own; a dismissal and an acknowledgement are always a person's deliberate choice.
- **Execution** — a change was actually sent to the ticket, or an execution **failed**. Automatic executions and their failures show here too.
- **Configuration** — someone changed how an agent runs: its **watching settings** or general **configuration** were updated, an action type was switched to **automatic** or **turned off** (or **demoted** back to asking first), or an **agent was deleted**. Safety limits landing — **Daily safety cap reached** and **Per-run safety cap reached** — are filed here too rather than under Error, because a cap doing its job is a deliberate stop, not a malfunction.
- **Checks** — the agent looked for work. One entry per check, whether or not it found anything. See below.
- **Pause** — an **emergency pause was enabled** or **lifted**, or a **ticket watcher was paused** because a pause was in effect.
- **Error** — something went wrong that you should know about: a single **ticket could not be processed**, a **run failed**, the **ticket watcher failed**, or an automatic execution failed.

You don't need to memorise these — the event titles are written in plain language, and the type chips let you filter down to the ones you care about.

### Check entries

A check entry tells you what the agent found, in its title, without you having to expand anything:

- **Ticket check — no new tickets** — it looked and there was nothing to do. This is what a healthy, quiet agent looks like.
- **Ticket check — 3 new tickets** — three tickets were picked up for work.
- **Ticket check — 3 new tickets, 2 already seen, 1 error** — the same, plus tickets it had already handled and a problem it hit.
- **Ticket check — Not watching** / **Paused** / **Skipped** / **Failed** — the check didn't do its normal job, and the reason follows where there is one.

**Show details** breaks the same check down into four numbers — **Seen**, **Queued**, **Already seen**, **Handled** — plus the reason and any error messages. That is the honest way to answer "why didn't the agent pick up ticket #482?": if **Seen** is high but **Queued** is zero, the ticket was looked at and filtered out by your targeting; if **Seen** is zero, the agent never saw it at all.

## Show details

**Show details** expands an entry into the full evidence behind it. Depending on the event, you may see:

- The **check breakdown** described above.
- The complete **Proposed message** — the full text the agent drafted, not just the one-line preview.
- **Field changes**, written as "Field: from → to" (for example "Status: Assigned → Pending"), so a classification, status, assignment, or participant change is legible without opening the ticket.
- The **Reason** — the agent's short justification for the proposal.
- The **Reviewer note** — the note captured when the proposal was decided.
- A **"{n} sources cited"** line — how many of your [Knowledge library](knowledge.md) results backed the drafted reply. This is the honest signal of whether the reply is grounded in your own sources; a reply with cited sources is one the agent could stand behind. Its absence on an administrative or procedural reply is normal and does not mean something failed — for how that plays out during review, see [Approvals](agents-approvals.md).

## Loading more

The timeline loads the 50 most recent matching entries and tells you where you stand: **{n} of {total} shown**. **Load more** appends the next 50 without disturbing what you've already read or the filters you set. There is no page number to lose your place in — keep pressing until you reach what you're looking for.

The counter is worth reading on its own. "50 of 1,284 shown" is a signal that you should probably narrow the filters rather than keep clicking.

Entries don't stay forever. Each agent keeps its own history for as long as its **Keep activity history (days)** setting says — 30 days by default, and anything older is deleted automatically overnight. If you need to keep a record beyond that, capture it while it's here. Work you still have to decide is never purged.

## Technical trace

The **Trace** button opens the **Technical trace** dialog over the page — nothing navigates away, so closing it puts you back exactly where you were. This is an optional diagnostics view aimed at administrators troubleshooting a specific check; you never need it for day-to-day review, and everything a requester or technician would want is already in **Show details**.

It reconstructs how a single check unfolded:

- When the run **started** and **finished**, and how long it **took** in total.
- The numbered **steps** the agent went through, each with its own status and how long it took.
- The **tool calls** it made, with their durations — useful when a check was slow or timed out.
- The **evidence** it gathered, shown as a short summary plus the kind of source it came from.

Those timings are the point of the dialog: a check that took four minutes has one slow step in it, and this is where you find it.

A **Show raw trace** toggle reveals the underlying machine-readable record for the rare case where you need the exact detail; leave it collapsed otherwise.

The same **Trace** button appears in [Approvals](agents-approvals.md) and on an agent's **Monitor** tab, and opens this same dialog in place — which is the usual way to get here while reviewing.

## Tips

- Searching by **ticket number** is the fastest way to hand someone the full, ordered story of one ticket — check, proposal, decision, and what was sent — without clicking through the ticket itself.
- **Turn Checks on when an agent seems idle, and off again afterwards.** It is the difference between "the agent is broken" and "the agent is watching and there's nothing to do" — but it is noisy, which is why it starts off.
- Reach for the **Execution** filter to see only what actually left the building. Proposals and decisions are intentions; executions are the changes a requester or technician can see.
- A **Daily safety cap reached** entry is the system working as designed, not a bug. If an agent went quiet for the rest of a day, this is usually why — raise its daily limits in the agent's [Settings](agents-workspace.md) if the cap is too tight for your volume, and check the **Today** figures there before you pick a new number.
- Use **Trace** only when you're chasing a slow or failed check; for "what did it say and why did we approve it", **Show details** already has the answer.
- This page never changes anything, so it's safe to hand read-only (`ai_agents:reader`) access to anyone who needs to audit agent behaviour without the ability to act on it.
