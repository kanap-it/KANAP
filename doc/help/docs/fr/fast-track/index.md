# Fast Track Portefeuille : de la demande à la livraison

This guide walks you through the portfolio lifecycle -- from submitting your first request to delivering a finished project. It is designed to get you productive fast, not to cover every option.

!!! tip "Prefer a one-page summary? :material-file-pdf-box:"
    All the key steps on a single A4 page -- print it, pin it, share it with your team.

## The Big Picture

![Portfolio Workflow Overview](images/workflow-overview.png)

Every initiative in KANAP follows the same flow:

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Request** | Someone submits an idea or need |
| **Analyze & Score** | A committee reviews feasibility, captures a recommendation, and scores priority |
| **Approve** | Decision-makers greenlight (or reject) it |
| **Project** | The approved request becomes a project with a team, timeline, and effort plan |
| **Deliver** | The team executes, logs time, and tracks progress to completion |

This pipeline ensures every initiative is evaluated fairly, prioritized transparently, and tracked consistently. No more pet projects jumping the queue.

!!! info "Why this matters"
    The analysis and scoring step is what makes the difference between a wish list and a real portfolio. It gives leadership a defensible, data-driven basis for saying yes -- or no.

---

## Step 1: Submit a Request

Go to **Portefeuille > Demandes** and click **+ New Request**.

New requests open on **Summary** with the request property sidebar already visible. Start with the structural fields in the sidebar, then capture the narrative in **Purpose**.

<!-- screenshot: New Request espace de travail with Summary and property sidebar -->

Fill in the minimum details to get started:

| Field | What to enter |
|-------|--------------|
| **Name** | A clear, concise title for the initiative |
| **Source** | Where did this come from? (Business unit, regulation, IT strategy...) |
| **Category** | The type of initiative (e.g., New Application, Infrastructure, Process Improvement) |
| **Requestor** | Who is asking for this? |
| **Target Delivery Date** | When is this ideally needed by? |

Then use the **Purpose** document on **Summary** to explain the business need and expected outcome in plain language. If you already have a brief in Word, use the **Import** button on the Purpose editor to pull the `.docx` file in directly -- no copy-paste needed.

Click **Enregistrer**. Your request enters the pipeline with status **Pending Review**.

!!! tip "Keep it lean"
    You can add deeper analysis, linked knowledge, and supporting evidence later. The goal right now is to get the request into the governed intake flow.

For all available fields and options, see [Requests reference](../portfolio-requests.md).

---

## Step 2: Analyze and Score

This is the step that turns a backlog of ideas into a defensible portfolio. In the espace de travail de la demande, this work is split between the **Analysis** tab and the **Scoring** tab.

### Who Should Score?

!!! warning "Don't score alone"
    Scoring works best when done by a **committee** with diverse perspectives. Aim to include representatives from:

    - **IT Functional** -- understands business processes and application landscape
    - **IT Technical** -- understands infrastructure, architecture, and technical debt
    - **Cybersecurity** -- assesses risk, compliance, and security implications
    - **Business** -- validates strategic alignment and business value

    A single person's score is an opinion. A committee's score is a decision framework.

### Analysis Tab

Use **Analysis** to understand whether the request is viable enough to move forward.

<!-- screenshot: Analysis tab with feasibility review and business-process selector -->

Analysis combines four things:

- **Impacted Business Processes** so reviewers can see which operational areas the request touches
- **Feasibility Review** across seven dimensions
- **Risks & Mitigations** as a managed document (with DOCX import and export)
- **Analysis Recommendation** as the formal committee verdict

### Feasibility Analysis (7 Dimensions)

Beyond value, you need to assess whether this is actually doable. The feasibility analysis covers **seven dimensions**:

<!-- screenshot: Feasibility analysis radar chart or form -->

| Dimension | What you're checking |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Technical Feasibility** | Is the proposed approach technically sound? |
| **Integration & Compatibility** | Does it fit the existing landscape and interfaces? |
| **Infrastructure Needs** | Are hosting, platform, or operations changes realistic? |
| **Security & Compliance** | Are controls, obligations, and risks understood? |
| **Resource & Skills** | Do you have the people and expertise? |
| **Delivery Constraints** | Are timing, sequencing, and dependencies manageable? |
| **Change Management** | Can the organization absorb the change? |

Each dimension is rated from **Not assessed** to **Blocker**. Summary then surfaces the strongest concern level so major issues stay visible even when nobody is parked on the Analysis tab.

### Scoring Tab

Use **Scoring** to rate the request against your tenant's configured portfolio criteria.

<!-- screenshot: Scoring tab with weighted criteria -->

The exact criterion names and weights may vary by tenant, because they come from **Portefeuille > Paramètres**. KANAP calculates the weighted priority automatically, and some tenants also use a mandatory-bypass rule for work that must jump to the top of the queue.

### The Analysis Recommendation

After reviewing feasibility and scoring, write the **Analysis Recommendation**. This is a short narrative summary -- typically 2-4 sentences -- that captures the committee's verdict:

<!-- screenshot: Analysis Recommendation text field -->

!!! example "Good recommendation examples"
    - *"High strategic value, strong business case. Technical feasibility is moderate due to legacy integration. Recommend approval with a proof-of-concept phase."*
    - *"Low urgency, limited business impact. Resource constraints make Q2 delivery unlikely. Recommend deferral to H2."*

Submitting the recommendation publishes a formal decision into **Activity**, so the rationale and any linked status change stay attached to the request history.

The combination of **scores + feasibility + recommendation** gives decision-makers everything they need to approve or reject -- without having to sit through a two-hour presentation.

!!! info "Transparency is the point"
    When stakeholders ask "why was my request rejected?" or "why did that project get priority?", the analysis and scoring record provides the answer. This is what makes the pipeline fair.

For detailed scoring configuration and weight management, see [Settings reference](../portfolio-settings.md).

---

## Step 3: Approve and Convert

Once analysis and scoring are complete, it's decision time.

<!-- screenshot: Request with Approve button highlighted -->

1. **Review** the scores, feasibility, and recommendation
2. **Move the request** through **Candidate**, **On Hold**, or **Rejected** as needed while the review is still in progress
3. **Set the status** to **Approved** when the request is ready to enter delivery
4. Click **Convert to Project**

!!! tip "Seamless handoff"
    When you convert a request to a project, KANAP opens a conversion dialog where you can confirm the project name, planned dates, and initial effort. The request purpose is shown for reference, and linked request data carries forward into the project.

The request status changes to **Converted**, and a new project is created and linked back to the original request.

For requests that are not ready to convert, keep them in **Candidate**, move them to **On Hold**, or set them to **Rejected** with a reason.

See [Requests reference](../portfolio-requests.md) for all status transitions.

---

## Step 4: Set Up Your Project

Your new project inherits the request context, but it still needs execution setup.

Go to **Portefeuille > Projets** and open your newly created project. The espace de travail du projet has seven tabs -- **Summary**, **Activity**, **Timeline**, **Progress**, **Tasks**, **Scoring**, and **Base de connaissances** -- with a persistent **Project Properties** sidebar for core fields, team, and relations.

### Sidebar -- Assign Your People and Core Structure

<!-- screenshot: Project espace de travail with Team section expanded in the sidebar -->

Use the **Project Properties** sidebar to set up the core roles:

| Role | Who | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Business Sponsor** | Senior business leader | Accountable for business outcomes |
| **IT Sponsor** | Senior IT leader | Removes delivery blockers and backs the initiative |
| **IT Lead** | Technical project manager | Drives IT delivery |
| **Business Lead** | Business-side project manager | Drives business readiness and adoption |
| **IT Contributors / Business Contributors** | Team members doing the work | Feed delivery context, allocations, and scope filters |

!!! warning "Contributors must be configured first"
    For capacity planning to work, every contributor **must** be set up in **Portefeuille > Contributeurs** with:

    - Their **team** assignment
    - **Availability** (days per month)
    - **Skills**
    - **Classification defaults** (Source, Category, Stream, Company) so new tasks and requests are pre-filled automatically

    Without team, availability, and skills data, the roadmap generator can't calculate capacity, and your planning will be flying blind. See the [Contributors reference](../portfolio-team-members.md).

The same sidebar also keeps **Core Properties** and **Relations** visible while you work, so you no longer need separate Team or Relations tabs.

### Summary Tab -- Purpose and Project Cockpit

**Summary** is the project cockpit. It shows the current status, delivery window, effort consumption, team coverage, and latest activity in one pass. The **Purpose** editor is here too -- if your project brief already exists as a Word document, use the **Import** button to pull the `.docx` in directly.

### Progress Tab -- Validate Effort and Allocations

<!-- screenshot: Progress tab showing IT Effort and Business Effort fields -->

Use **Progress** to confirm the effort that will drive delivery planning:

- **IT Effort (MD)** -- Total man-days expected from IT contributors
- **Business Effort (MD)** -- Total man-days expected from business contributors

!!! info "These numbers feed the roadmap"
    The roadmap generator uses these effort estimates, combined with contributor availability, to automatically schedule projects on the timeline. More accurate estimates = better roadmaps.

### Timeline Tab -- Apply a Phase Template (Optional)

<!-- screenshot: Timeline tab with template selector -->

If your organization has defined phase templates (e.g., "Standard Project", "Agile Sprint Cycle"), you can apply one here to instantly scaffold your project timeline with predefined phases and milestones. The timeline can be viewed as a table or a Gantt chart.

You can also set dates manually or skip this entirely for simpler initiatives.

See [Projects reference](../portfolio-projects.md) for all project configuration options.

---

## Step 5: Track Execution

Now the real work begins. As the project progresses, keep KANAP updated.

### Update Progress

<!-- screenshot: Execution Progress slider -->

Use the **Execution Progress** slider on the Progress tab to reflect how far along the project is. This is a simple percentage (0-100%) that feeds dashboards and reports.

Move the project through statuses as work advances. In practice, most projects move from **Waiting List** or **Planned** into active execution:

**Waiting List / Planned** --> **In Progress** --> **In Testing** --> **Done**

### Log Time -- This is Critical

!!! warning "No time logging = no automatic scheduling"
    Time logging isn't just for reporting -- it directly powers the roadmap generator.

There are two places to log time:

1. **Progress tab** -- Log project-level overhead time (meetings, coordination, management)
2. **Tasks** -- Log task-specific time against individual work items

<!-- screenshot: Time logging dialog -->

Here's why this matters:

```
Time logged --> Contributor time statistics --> Historical capacity data
                                            --> Roadmap generator (historical mode)
                                            --> Accurate future scheduling
```

The roadmap generator has a **historical capacity mode** that uses actual logged time to understand how much each contributor really delivers per month (as opposed to their theoretical availability). Without time data, the generator falls back to theoretical estimates -- which are almost always optimistic.

!!! tip "Make it a habit"
    Encourage team members to log time weekly. Even rough entries are far better than nothing. The data compounds over time and makes each roadmap iteration more accurate.

### Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Waiting List** | Approved but not scheduled into active work yet |
| **Planned** | Scheduled and prepared, but execution has not started |
| **In Progress** | Active work is happening |
| **In Testing** | Deliverables are being validated |
| **On Hold** | Temporarily paused (capture the reason) |
| **Done** | All deliverables accepted, project complete |
| **Cancelled** | Stopped before completion |

See [Projects reference](../portfolio-projects.md) for details on each status.

---

## Step 6: Structure with Phases and Tasks

For larger projects, you'll want more granular tracking.

### Phases

Phases break the project into logical stages (e.g., Analysis, Development, Testing, Deployment).

<!-- screenshot: Project phases view -->

- **From template**: Apply a phase template from the Timeline tab to get a predefined structure
- **Custom**: Add phases manually with names, start/end dates, and owners

Each phase can have its own status, dates, and milestone behavior. The Timeline tab lets you view the phase structure as a table or a Gantt chart.

### Tâches

Within each phase (or at the project level), create tasks for specific work items. Open the **Tasks** tab in the espace de travail du projet to manage them.

<!-- screenshot: Task list within a phase -->

- Assign tasks to contributors
- Set due dates, priorities, and task types
- Write detailed descriptions using the markdown editor -- or **import a `.docx` file** directly into the Description field
- Log time directly against tasks (IT or Business category)
- Link tasks to phases for structured tracking
- Attach **Base de connaissances** documents from the task sidebar for reference material

Tasks can also be created directly from a timeline phase using the **[+]** shortcut, which pre-links the task to both the project and the selected phase.

!!! tip "Project tasks must log time before closing"
    You cannot mark a project task as **Done** until at least some time has been logged. This keeps effort tracking honest.

### Milestones

Mark key checkpoints -- go/no-go decisions, deliverable deadlines, or external dependencies.

<!-- screenshot: Milestone on timeline -->

Milestones appear on the project timeline and in reports, giving stakeholders clear visibility into upcoming decision points. They can be created as standalone milestones or by enabling milestone tracking on a phase.

!!! tip "Start simple, add structure as needed"
    You don't need phases and tasks for every project. Small initiatives can be tracked with just the progress slider and status. Add structure when the project is complex enough to need it.

For full details on phases, tasks, and milestones, see [Projects reference](../portfolio-projects.md) and [Tasks reference](../tasks.md).

## How It All Connects

Every piece of data you enter feeds into something bigger. Here's why it's worth the effort:

### Automatic Roadmap Scheduling

The roadmap generator takes your project effort estimates, contributor availability, and historical time data to **automatically schedule projects** across the timeline. No more manual Gantt chart gymnastics.

See [Planning reference](../portfolio-planning.md).

### Capacity Heatmaps

Contributor availability and project assignments combine to show you **who's overloaded and who has bandwidth** -- across teams and time periods. This prevents the classic "everyone is assigned to 5 projects at 100%" problem.

### Bottleneck Analysis

When multiple projects compete for the same contributors or skills, KANAP highlights the bottleneck so you can make trade-offs before they become crises.

### Executive Reporting

Priority scores, project status, progress, budget, and timeline data roll up into **portfolio-level reports** that give leadership a clear picture without manual PowerPoint creation. The reporting hub includes a Status Change Report, Capacity Heatmap, and Weekly Report.

See [Reporting reference](../portfolio-reporting.md).
