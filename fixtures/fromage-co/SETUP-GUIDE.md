# Fromage & Co Demo Tenant — Setup Guide

Fromage & Co is the KANAP demo tenant: a European cheese group with four legal
entities, ~50 applications, spend/CAPEX budgets, a project portfolio, an IT
landscape with interfaces and connections, a Service Desk knowledge library,
and a demo AI agent working mock helpdesk tickets.

Everything is created through the public API by a single idempotent runner:

```bash
node fixtures/fromage-co/setup-tenant.mjs \
  --base-url https://fromage.dev.kanap.net \
  --email fried@kanap.net \
  --password '<admin password>'
```

The runner is safe to re-run: every step looks up existing records before
creating anything.

## What the runner does

1. **Tenant bootstrap** (if login fails): `POST /public/start-trial` →
   `POST /public/activate-trial` → sets the admin password. See
   "Tenant creation and CAPTCHA" below.
2. **Settings**: currencies (EUR/USD), IT Ops server kinds, operating systems,
   DNS domains, connection entities.
3. **Portfolio classification** (sources, categories, streams) and
   **analytics categories**.
4. **CSV imports** (01→19): companies, charts of accounts, suppliers,
   departments, contacts, users, business processes, applications, contracts,
   spend, CAPEX, portfolio projects and requests, locations, assets, tasks.
   The companies import is pinned to `--year` (default 2026) because year
   columns are relative to the import year.
5. **Demo user passwords**: all 16 imported users get `--demo-password`
   (default `Fromage2026!`) so you can log in as e.g.
   `thomas.berger@fromage-co.com` during a demo. Pass `--demo-password ''`
   to skip.
6. **Relations**: Microsoft 365 suite members, application↔department links,
   app instances, interfaces + bindings, connections + equipment hops,
   interface↔connection links, contract↔spend links, spend↔application links,
   portfolio teams and capacity, project phases and team members, company
   allocations on selected spend/CAPEX versions.
7. **Service Desk Docs**: a knowledge library with five published guides
   (VPN, SAP access, CaveGuard alerts, guest Wi-Fi, label printers). The
   documents are in `docs/*.md`.
8. **Demo AI agent**: `Fromage Service Desk Agent`, bound to the built-in
   mock ticketing provider, with a persona, a shared-context profile, and a
   scope targeting the `fromage-helpdesk` entity. The mock provider ships five
   fromage tickets whose answers live in the Service Desk Docs — the agent's
   knowledge search finds them during triage. The runner triggers one
   ingestion poll and one mock triage so the Activity and Approvals pages have
   content immediately.

Flags: `--skip-relations`, `--skip-agents`, `--org`, `--country`, `--year`,
`--activation-token` (see below).

## Environments

| Environment | Base URL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dev | `https://fromage.dev.kanap.net` | Local stack behind the Cloudflare tunnel |
| QA | `https://fromage.qa.kanap.net` | |
| Prod | `https://fromage.kanap.net` | Live demos |

The runner auto-detects whether the API is served under `/api` (nginx-proxied
environments) or at the root.

## Tenant creation

Trial signup is the only tenant-creation path, and CAPTCHA is enforced on all
environments, so create the tenant **exactly like a customer would** — no
tokens, no scripting:

1. On the marketing site, start a trial with slug `fromage` and your own
   email (on dev/QA all outbound mail is redirected to `fried@kanap.net`).
2. Click the activation link in the email and set your password on the
   activation page — the tenant now exists and you are its Administrator.
3. Run the runner with that email and password. It logs in and does
   everything else.

The runner only needs its bootstrap mode (`--activation-token`) for headless
setups: pass it the activation **link** (or bare token) from the email
instead of clicking it, and it will activate the tenant and set the password
itself.

If the tenant already exists (re-running after a previous setup), the runner
just logs in and updates everything in place.

## Recreating from scratch

To wipe and rebuild (e.g. on QA):

1. Log in to platform-admin (`https://platform-admin.<env>.kanap.net`) as a
   platform administrator.
2. Delete the `fromage` tenant (requires typing the slug to confirm). This
   purges all tenant data, frees the slug and clears the trial signup.
3. Follow "Tenant creation and CAPTCHA" above, then run the runner.

## AI prerequisites

Cloud installs (dev/QA/prod) use the platform's built-in LLM — no per-tenant
configuration needed. On-premise installs must configure an LLM endpoint in
the AI settings before the demo agent can triage tickets; everything else in
the fixture works without AI.

## Demo logins

| Who | Email | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Tenant owner | the `--email` you passed | Administrator |
| Thomas Berger (CIO) | `thomas.berger@fromage-co.com` | Administrator |
| Sophie Laurent | `sophie.laurent@fromage-co.com` | IT Landscape Administrator |
| Marie Fontaine | `marie.fontaine@fromage-co.com` | Budget Administrator |

All demo users share the `--demo-password` (default `Fromage2026!`).

## Files

- `setup-tenant.mjs` — the runner (Node ≥ 20, no dependencies).
- `01-…25-*.csv` — the dataset (semicolon-separated, UTF-8).
- `docs/*.md` — the Service Desk Docs contents.
- The fromage mock helpdesk tickets live in the backend's mock ticketing
  provider (`backend/src/ai/control-plane/providers/mocks/mock-ticketing.provider.ts`,
  entity `fromage-helpdesk`) so they are available in every environment
  without seeding.
