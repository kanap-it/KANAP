# Performance bench (perf plan, step 0)

Scripts to build a large tenant and measure KANAP under load. No dependencies, Node 20 or later.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `generate-dataset.mjs` | Deterministic CSV dataset in the Fromage fixture formats, scaled (default 5,000 OPEX, 1,000 CAPEX, 1,500 suppliers, 800 accounts, 300 cost centres, 4 dimensions, 800 contracts, 5 budget years) |
| `load-tenant.mjs` | Loads the dataset through the API and the real CSV import endpoints, and times each step |
| `bench.mjs` | `single`: one request at a time, warm, per heavy endpoint. `load`: N virtual users replaying the list and workspace request patterns, with server-side sampling |
| `explain.sql` | `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` of the list's main SQL and of the chargeback amounts query, read-only |
| `lib/http.mjs` | HTTP client on `node:http` (6 connections per virtual user, like a browser over HTTP/1.1) |

## Environment used on 2026-10-01

- Database `appdb_perf` on the dev Postgres (`kanap-db-1`). Never another database.
- API container `kanap-perf-api`, built from `backend/Dockerfile` (compiled `dist/`, migrations at boot), single-tenant mode, tenant slug `perf`, published on `127.0.0.1:18080`.
- Minimal env file (no external keys): `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=single-tenant`, `DEFAULT_TENANT_SLUG=perf`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD`, random `JWT_SECRET`, `NODE_ENV=production`, `APP_ENV=perf` (non-production checks: permissive CORS), `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=false`, `CAPTCHA_MODE=off`, AI flags off, `EMAIL_OVERRIDE` to a `.invalid` address and no mail key, `S3_ENDPOINT` pointing at a closed local port, `DB_APP_NAME=kanap-perf-api` (to find its connections in `pg_stat_activity`). Do not set `SEED_ADMIN=true` in single-tenant mode: that path returns from `bootstrap()` before the server listens when the tenant does not exist yet.

## Rerun

```bash
S=<scratch dir>            # holds perf-api.env, credentials, dataset, results
W=<this worktree>

# 1. API (one image build at a time; check `free -g` first)
docker build -t kanap-perf-api -f $W/backend/Dockerfile $W/backend
docker run -d --name kanap-perf-api --network kanap_default -p 127.0.0.1:18080:8080 \
  --env-file $S/perf-api.env --memory=3g kanap-perf-api
# later: docker start kanap-perf-api / docker stop kanap-perf-api

# 2. Dataset + load (about 7 minutes in total on an empty tenant)
node $W/scripts/perf/generate-dataset.mjs --out $S/dataset
node $W/scripts/perf/load-tenant.mjs --base-url http://127.0.0.1:18080 \
  --email <admin> --password <pw> --data $S/dataset --results $S/results
#   --only settings,master,items,budget,costed,allocations,links,projects,projectlinks,tasks,fx
#   reruns a subset. Imports are upserts; tasks are not (a second run duplicates them).

# 3. Bench (bench-config.json: baseUrl, admin, members[], pg, container)
node $W/scripts/perf/bench.mjs single --config $S/bench-config.json --out $S/results/single.json
for v in "1 180 5" "10 240 30" "25 240 30" "50 300 60"; do set -- $v
  node $W/scripts/perf/bench.mjs load --config $S/bench-config.json --vus $1 --duration $2 --ramp $3 \
    --out $S/results/load-$1vu.json
done

# 4. Plans
PGPASSWORD=app psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U app -d appdb_perf -v tenant=perf -f $W/scripts/perf/explain.sql
```

To start from an empty database again: stop the container, drop and recreate `appdb_perf` with the
extensions `citext, pgcrypto, uuid-ossp, unaccent, pg_trgm` (owner `app`), start the container
(migrations run at boot and create the tenant and the admin), then steps 2 to 4.

## Line lifecycle in the dataset

About 8 % of the lines ended last year (end of validity `<year - 1>-12-31`). The imports require the
status cell to follow the end of validity (a line whose end has passed and that says `enabled` is
refused), so these lines are written `disabled`: 433 of the 5,000 OPEX lines and 77 of the 1,000
CAPEX lines with the default seed. With `--year` set to the current year or earlier (the default is
2026) the files do not depend on the day they are generated; with a later `--year` those lines end
in the future and are written `enabled`. Same seed and parameters, same files.

Load check, 2026-10-02 (branch `perf/cc-tree-light`): an empty database (`CREATE DATABASE` as `app`, the five
extensions), the migrations run by the API at boot, then `load-tenant.mjs` from the generated files:
every step passed in 622 s, with only the expected whole-file refusals of the two largest files (413,
then sent in chunks). Result: 5,000 OPEX (4,567 enabled, 433 disabled, none enabled past its end),
1,000 CAPEX (923 and 77), 23,209 OPEX versions and 278,508 amount rows, as in the `perf` tenant.

## What the load mode replays

Each virtual user logs in (VU 0 as the administrator, the others as budget members), opens the
OPEX list, then loops: think time 2 to 5 s, then one scenario drawn from this mix.

| Scenario | Weight | Requests (source) |
|---|---|---|
| list open | 14 | `/budget-columns`, `/analytics-axes`, `/users?limit=1000` (cached 5 min / 30 s), then 1 block + 3 footer totals in parallel (`OpexListPage.tsx:258-278`, `ServerDataGrid.tsx:492-511, 627-635`) |
| sort change | 8 | toggles amount sort and `item_number`: 2 blocks in sequence + 2 totals |
| set filter open + 3 clicks | 8 | paying company set filter: `filter-values`, then per click 2 blocks + 1 total |
| column text filter (typed) | 7 | 5 characters, 120 to 200 ms apart, 1 block + 1 total per character (no debounce), then clear |
| quick search | 10 | 1 block + 1 total (400 ms debounce) |
| scroll 10 blocks | 6 | blocks 2 to 11 in sequence (`maxConcurrentDatasourceRequests = 1`) |
| open an item | 16 | wave 1: detail (it names the line's cost center: no cost-centre tree), `/summary/ids`, settings, suppliers and companies lists (1,000 rows), one value list per dimension; wave 2 on `data.id`: 5 relation counts, tasks, `/users?limit=1000` (share dialog), owner pickers, accounts of the company + account by id (`SpendItemPage.tsx` and children) |
| next x10 | 10 | per step: detail, then 5 relation counts + tasks (+ owners and accounts when not cached) |
| field save | 11 | `PATCH /spend-items/:id {notes}` then detail refetch |
| budget cell save | 10 | budget tab (company, versions, freeze state, yearly totals, then amounts of the year), then `POST /spend-versions/:id/amounts/bulk-upsert {kind: monthly, months: [{period, forecast}]}` |

`--list capex` (both modes) replays the CAPEX list on `/capex-items` instead: no `/users` request on
open (the CAPEX page asks for none), the text filter on `description`, the sort toggling between the
amount sort and the priority dimension's column, `analytics_<id>:ASC` in the order of its values (the
id of the dimension coded `priority`, read from `/analytics-axes` at list open; a dimension since lot
C1), and no workspace. Its mix: the six
list actions above with their weights, then `open an item (ordered ids)` (16: `/summary/ids` of the
list state) and `next (neighbours)` (10: `/summary/neighbors?id=CPX-n` of a line of the first 50).
In `single` mode it times the CAPEX page (default sort, grid rows, priority dimension sort, item
number sort, quick search, paying company filter), totals, filter values (paying company and the
priority dimension, `fields=analytics_<id>`), ids and neighbours. A tenant without an enabled
dimension coded `priority` fails the CAPEX list open and sort changes (`load`) or stops the run
(`single`), with that reason.

`--list reports` (both modes) replays the budget reports and the dashboard's budget tiles (lot 2D).
A report open sends what the page sends: the settings-like reads (budget columns, dimensions, the
number of cost centres, cached 5 min; the tree itself loads only for a report filtered on a node), the filter bar's options (run or build present, the values per enabled
dimension) and the report's own `POST …/summary/aggregate`; the item exclusion picker is its own
scenario (every line by name). Its mix: top items 14, increases 14, consolidation 10, analytics 10,
OPEX trend 10, CAPEX top items 10, dashboard budget tiles 16 (hygiene counts of both types, top
increases), item exclusion picker 6. With `--legacy 1` the same opens replay the pattern before lot 2D
(every line downloaded through `/summary`, pages of 500 full rows one after the other, cached 5 min;
the hygiene counts as `/summary?limit=1`), on the same image: `/summary` is unchanged. In `single`
mode each open runs with empty caches and reports its time, requests and bytes. `--cold 1` (any
list) turns the client cache off in `load` mode: every open asks everything, the worst case.

React Query caching is modelled per virtual user (30 s default stale time, 5 min for settings-like
hooks). 403 answers (budget members may not read users or currency settings, which the pages ask
for anyway) are reported apart and not counted as errors.

Server side, every 2 s: `pg_stat_activity` for `application_name = kanap-perf-api` (active, idle in
transaction, waiting on a lock); `docker stats` every second; every second a CORS preflight
`OPTIONS /health`, answered by the cors middleware before any database access, as an event-loop
lag probe (the ops metrics endpoint is multi-tenant only and its histogram is never reset).
