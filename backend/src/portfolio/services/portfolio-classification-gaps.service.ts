/**
 * Counts the open portfolio items that still miss a classification value.
 *
 * Only the fields a user can actually fill are counted. Classification lives on standalone
 * tasks and project tasks; the task service nulls it on contract / spend item / capex item /
 * incident tasks, so those are out of scope and would otherwise be permanent false positives.
 *
 * A project task with no classification of its own inherits its project's, and the task list
 * shows that inherited value. The counts use the same COALESCE, so a figure never sends the
 * user to a list where the column is already filled.
 *
 * A missing stream is only a gap when the item already has a category and that category
 * offers at least one active stream. Many categories have no stream at all, and an item
 * without a category is already counted under the category gap.
