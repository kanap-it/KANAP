          a: 'KANAP is licensed under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AGPL v3</a>, a widely recognised open source license approved by the OSI. You can freely use, modify and distribute the software. The AGPL copyleft clause ensures that anyone running a modified version as a service must share their changes. This protects the community and keeps KANAP genuinely open.',

          q: 'Can I use KANAP commercially?',
          a: 'Yes. Internal use, commercial use, external SaaS, all allowed. The copyleft provision only requires you to share modifications if you run a modified version as a network service. Pure internal use does not trigger any obligation.',

          q: 'What happens after my trial?',

          q: 'What is the free activation session?',
          a: 'Each trial includes one free 60-minute activation session per company. After subscription we email you to book the call. The session is a video call focused on first-value milestones based on your main objectives.',

          q: 'What is the difference between cloud and self-hosted?',
          a: 'Cloud hosting means we run everything for you: hosting, updates, backups, infrastructure and priority support. Self-hosted means you run KANAP on your own servers. The full product is free to self-host; you can purchase Self-Hosted Support if you want priority help while keeping control of your infrastructure.',

          a: 'Hosted KANAP includes a generous number of Plaid messages, powered by a mid-range model we\'ve carefully selected and tested with KANAP. For even more capable responses, the Bring Your Own Key option lets you connect state-of-the-art models from OpenAI, Anthropic, or any compatible provider. BYOK also gives you full control over how your data is processed, and removes any message limit.',

          a: 'At platform level, Plaid can be fully disabled, enabled in read-only mode, or enabled in read-write mode (with preview and confirmation for all changes). Web search and MCP can be enabled or disabled separately. At user level, you control who has access to which Plaid feature through role-based permissions. RBAC is always enforced, Plaid never sees more than the user is allowed to.',

      items: [
        {
          q: 'Are the agents autonomous?',
          a: 'Yes, by design. An agent starts supervised: it proposes actions and you review them. As KANAP measures how often it gets things right, you grant it more autonomy, until it handles routine work on its own and only escalates what needs a person. You decide how far that goes.',
        },
        {
          q: 'How do I control what an agent can do?',
          a: 'You set each agent\'s autonomy level and scope it to the operations you allow. Agents act only through defined operations, with no raw database or shell access. Every action is recorded, you can pause any agent immediately, and you can cap what an agent spends on the LLM.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Can I trust an agent with real work?',
          a: 'That is what the controls are for. An agent reasons over your own IT data rather than guessing, cites the sources it used, and records every action in the same audit trail as the rest of KANAP. It earns autonomy by proving itself on real tasks, and you can stop it at any time.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Which tools do agents work with today?',
          a: 'Today, a service desk. One autonomous agent works a real service desk in production, which is what proves the model. The runtime is built to drive other systems, monitoring, virtualization, directory services and more, each behind a connector.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Can I write my own agent or connector?',
          a: 'Yes. The code is open, and an agent\'s reasoning is kept separate from how it talks to any given tool. You can write a connector for the system you need, or change how an agent works, because you have the full source. If you would rather we build a connector, contact us.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Are agents included in the free open-source version?',
          a: 'Yes. Agents are part of the open-source product under AGPL v3, with no AI feature gate. You bring your own LLM key, the same model as Plaid. Self-host the full platform for free, agents included.',
        },
        {
          q: 'What does it cost to run agents?',
          a: 'Agents use an LLM, so you bring your own key and pay your provider for what they use. KANAP itself is free to self-host. You keep cost predictable with a per-agent spend cap.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Do agent actions stay on my own servers?',
          a: 'On a self-hosted deployment, yes. Agent reasoning and actions happen inside your own deployment, and your tickets and documents never leave it. The only external call is to the LLM provider you choose.',
